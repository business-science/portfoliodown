The goal of `portfoliodown` is to make it _painless for data scientists_ to create a polished professional website so they can host their project portfolios __(and get great job interviews)__.



## Example: Data Science Portfolio

__Check out an example data science portfolio__ at [https://mattdancho.netlify.app/](https://mattdancho.netlify.app/). It took 15-minutes to make this with `portfoliodown`.

## Portfoliodown Theme Demos:

- [Raditian Theme](https://mattdancho.netlify.app/) (Default)

- [Kross Theme](https://mattdancho-kross.netlify.app/)



## Installation

You can install the development version of `portfoliodown` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("business-science/portfoliodown")
```

## Getting Started

- The portfolio website is automatically generated with `portfoliodown::new_portfolio_site()`, and can then be customized as a `blogdown` website.

## Acknowledgements

The `portfoliodown` package would not be possible without the awesome work of:

- The [Blogdown Team](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and its team at RStudio

- The [raditian-free-hugo-theme](https://github.com/radity/raditian-free-hugo-theme). This is one of the best hugo portfolio templates around.

- The [kross-hugo-theme](https://github.com/themefisher/kross-hugo). Another great portfolio template.
