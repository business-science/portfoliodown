# portfoliodown

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of portfoliodown is to make is painless to create a polished personal website for data scientists so they can host their project portfolios (and get interviews).

## Installation

You can install the development version of `portfoliodown` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("business-science/portfoliodown")
```

## Example Data Science Portfolio

I've hosted an example portfolio at [https://mattdancho.netlify.app/](https://mattdancho.netlify.app/). This portfolio website is automatically generated with `portfoliodown::new_portfolio_site()`, and can then be customized as a `blogdown` website.

```{r, echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/example_portfolio.gif")
```
