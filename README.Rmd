# portfoliodown

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `portfoliodown` is to make it _painless for data scientists_ to create a polished personal website so they can host their project portfolios __(and get great job interviews)__.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `portfoliodown` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("business-science/portfoliodown")
```

## Example Data Science Portfolio

- __Check out an example data science portfolio__ at [https://mattdancho.netlify.app/](https://mattdancho.netlify.app/). 

- The portfolio website is automatically generated with `portfoliodown::new_portfolio_site()`, and can then be customized as a `blogdown` website.

```{r, echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("vignettes/example_portfolio.gif")
```

## Acknowledgements

The `portfoliodown` package would not be possible without the awesome work of the [raditian-free-hugo-theme](https://github.com/radity/raditian-free-hugo-theme). This is one of the best hugo portfolio templates around.
