The goal of `portfoliodown` is to make it *painless for data scientists*
to create a polished personal website so they can host their project
portfolios **(and get great job interviews)**.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `portfoliodown` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("business-science/portfoliodown")
```

## Example Data Science Portfolio

## Getting Started

-   The portfolio website is automatically generated with
    `portfoliodown::new_portfolio_site()`, and can then be customized as
    a `blogdown` website.

## Acknowledgements

The `portfoliodown` package would not be possible without the awesome
work of the
[raditian-free-hugo-theme](https://github.com/radity/raditian-free-hugo-theme).
This is one of the best hugo portfolio templates around.
