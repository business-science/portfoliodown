The goal of `portfoliodown` is to make it *painless for data scientists*
to create a polished professional website so they can host their project
portfolios **(and get great job interviews)**.

## Example: Data Science Portfolio

**Check out an example data science portfolio** at
<https://mattdancho.netlify.app/>. It took 15-minutes to make this with
`portfoliodown`.
